   <h1> Lohaghat (Kumaoni: LoghƒÅt)</h1><p> is a town and a nagar palika in Champawat district in the Indian state of Uttarakhand.</p>

   <h1> History</h1>
   <p>Lohaghat and its surrounding region was earlier known as Sui, and the town has been a place of prominence since the rule of Katyuri kings. A scion of the Katyuri dynasty had established his principality at Sui in the eighth century.[2] The rulers of Sui were feudatory to the Katyuris until the fragmentation of the Katyuri kingdom in the end of the 10th century, after which, they became feudatories of Doti.[3] Brahma Dev Katyuri, the last Katyuri governor of Sui was having trouble managing his areas due to several rebellions by local Khasia chiefs. The Khasia chiefs subsequently unified under a Raut king of Damkot thus increasing problems for Brahmadev, who married off his daughter to prince Somchand, and bestowed him with his principality as dowry.[3]</p>
    
    
   <h1> The Mist conquering the Fort of Banasur in Lohaghat.</h1>
  <p>The fort was built by the Chand Kings in the 12th century.</p><br>
   <p> Som Chand established his capital at Champawat and after defeating the Raut king of Sui with the help of his military officer Kalu Tadagi, bought the entire region under his authority thus laying the foundations of the rule of Chand dynasty in Kumaon.[4] Lohaghat remained under the Kingdom of Kumaon until the fall of Almora at the hand of Gurkhas in 1790. The Banasur fort was built here by the Chand kings in the 12th century.</p><br>
    
  <p> Lohaghat came under the control of the East India Company following the defeat of Gurkhas in Anglo-Nepal War of 1814 and the Treaty of Sugauli in 1816. The Britishers were impressed by the natural beauty of the place and began to settle here. The lands of Fernhill and Chanuwankhal were leased to Hensi and Mrs Hoskin for tea and fruit production.[5] The lands of Hensi were later transferred to an Englishman named 'Talak' which came to be known as 'Talak Estate'.[6]</p><br>
    
   <p>The arrival of the British commenced an era of development in Lohaghat; efforts were made for development of education, health, revenue, legal, land settlement, construction of roads etc.[6] Lohaghat was made the headquarters of the Kali Kumaon Sub Division. The jail built at that time still serves as the temporary prison of Champawat district. An army contingent was stationed also stationed here; barracks were built near the present hospital complex and a permanent camp was established at Lohaghat for which soldiers of the British Army were brought here from Hawalbagh in 1939.[7] Maneuvers used to be carried out at the 'Chandmari' situated near the present location of the government inter college. However, a local rebellion of 1846 resulted in the removal of military camp from Lohaghat and the troops were transferred back to Hawalbagh until the establishment of another permanent Cantonment at Ranikhet.[6]<br></p>
