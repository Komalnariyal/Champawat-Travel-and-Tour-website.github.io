            <h1>Golu Devta Temple</h1>
          <p> Golu Devta is considered to be an incarnation of Gaur Bhairav (Shiva), and is worshipped all over the Kumaon and Garhwal region. He is worshipped as the god of justice and he serves it well. His mantra is the following: "Jai Nyay Devta Goljyu Tumar Jai ho. Sabuk lije dain haije" (Translation: ‘Hail the God of justice: Goljyu! Blessings for everyone’).</p><br>
            
           <p>Golu Devta is seen in the form of Lord Shiva, while his brother Kalva Devta is in the form of Bhairava and Garh Devi is in the form of Shakti. Golu Devta is also prayed as a key deity (Ista/Kula Devata) in many villages in Kumaon and Garhwal regions of Uttarakhand. Normally three days pooja or 9 days pooja is performed to worship Lord Golu Devta, who is known as Goreel Devta in Chamoli District. Golu Devta is offered ghee, milk, curd, halwa, poori, and pakauri .Golu Devta is offered with White Cloths, white pagari and white shaal. Only the male black goat is an offer for Bali.</p><br>
            
            <p>Golu Dev used to travel far distances on his horse and used to meet people of his kingdom, in a practice called Golu Darbar: Golu Dev used to hear the problems of the people and help them in any way possible. He had a special place for people in his heart and he was always ready to help them. Due to his complete dedication to people, he led a very simple life, following the principles of brahmacharya. Golu dev still meets with his people and in many villages the practice of Golu darbar is still prevalent, where Golu dev appears in front of people, listens to their problems and helps people in every way possible. In present times, the most common form of Golu Dev Darbar is Jagar. Golu Dev always had a special place in his heart for his white horse, and it is believed that he still rides his white horse to travel around.</p><br>
            
           <h1> Origin </h1>
            <p>He is regarded as the dispenser of justice. Historically, he is considered as the brave son of king Jhal Rai and his wife Kalinka. His grandfather was Hal Rai and great-grandfather was Hal Rai. Historically Champawat is considered as the origin of Golu Devta. His mother Kalinka is believed to be the sister of two other local deities: Harishchandra Devjyun (the divine spirit of Raja Harish of the Chands) and Sem Devjyun. Both deities are also regarded as Lord Golu’s uncles.</p><br>
            
           <p>Tales about his birth differ from place to place, the most popular story about Golu talks of a local king who, while hunting, sent his servants to look for water. The servants disturbed a woman who was praying. The woman, in a fit of anger, taunted the king that he could not separate two fighting bulls and proceeded to do so herself. The king was very impressed to see this and he married the lady. When this queen gave birth to a son, the other queens, who were jealous of her, replaced the boy with a stone only to put him in a cage and cast him into the river. The child was brought up by a fisherman. Later when the boy realised about his true identity he decided to seek out the injustice done to his mother. He goes to the lake with a wooden horse and tries to make the horse drink water from the lake, seeing this the king asked the boy how can he make the wooden horse drink water at which the kid asked the king if a woman can give birth to a stone then the horse can also drink water. The king realised his mistake and accepted him as his son. He then treated these subjects with care and concern and became popular for his justice and was regarded as Gwalla devta.</p><br>
            
          <p> According to another story he was the general in the army of Chand king Baz Bahadur. Gwala Devta also known as “Gwala” which means a herder of Cows. There is also a well known saying about Golu Devta, that if you tie up a bell in the neck of a sacred cow, the ringing equals to 1000 bells in a holy temple. It was his belief that all 33 crores gods and Goddesses are present in a single temple.<p><br>
