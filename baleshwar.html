            <h1>Lord shiva Temple</h1>
            <p>The temple is situated in Baleshwar i.e 76 km from Pithoragarh within the city of Champawat in Uttarakhand. It is the most artistic temple of the area. Built by the rulers of Chand dynasty, Baleshwar Temple is a marvelous symbol of stone carving. The main Baleshwar temple is dedicated to Lord Shiva who is also known as Baleshwar. There are two other temples in the compound of Baleshwar, one dedicated to Ratneshwar and the other to Champawati Durga. The exteriors of these temples are carved with posters of local deities.

                The temple is an example of South Indian Architecture with magnificent stone carving works. There was a freshwater resource ‘Naula’ which has dried up now. This temple has been declared a National Heritage Monument and is looked after by the Archeological Survey of India(ASI) since 1952. It is constructed in south Indian construction style. The temple once had intricate structural features and a sanctuary with a mandap. The intricate carvings are still visible on the ceilings of these temples. It is an evidence of their ancient glory and artistic excellence. The first story of Man-Eaters of Kumaon is related to this place.</p><br>
                <p>It is said that the ancient capital of the Chand rulers is well known for its temples and natural beauty. Champawat district is a source and origin of religion and culture of Uttarakhand. It was in Champawat that Lord Vishnu is said to have appeared as ‘Kurma avatar’. Hence, Kumaon also came to be known as Kurmanchal.  This isn’t any historical manuscript that dates the Baleshwar temple; however it is believed to have been built between the tenth and twelfth century AD. The legends associated to the temple relate to several Gods and Goddess. It has acquired the unique distinction of being the holy land of Gods and therefore, temples of very large variety dedicated to diverse gods including local deities and demons of restricted influence are spread over the whole expanse.
<br>
               It is open all the time for public visits and Mahashivratri is one festival celebrated with a colorful fair in the campus of the temple.<br>
                    
                 <br> 
              Temple is opened from 9 AM to 11.30 AM and from 5 PM to 8.30 PM.</p><br>
          <h1>How to reach</h1><br>
            <p><h3>By Road</h3> <br>
                Champawat is accessible by road as well, however, the journey by road is very tedious and not much recommended. Champawat is about 455 km from Delhi. The shortest route will be to first reach Haldwani (294 km) then to Bhowali (29 km from Haldwani) and then via Bhowali to Champawat ( 132 km from Bhowali) but the terrain makes it an unfavorable bet to travel by road. Better options would be by train or flight, but if you’re willing to go by road, be prepared for a tough ride.
         </p>   <br>
               <p><h3> By Rail </h3><br>
                Regular trains like the Sampark Kranti, Shatabdi and the Garib Rath that pass through the Kathgodam station, that is about 58 kms away from Champawat and the Tanakpur station, about 75 kms away. Your best bet is to cover the distance between is to take a tourist bus, since many individual cab drivers are not ready to drive to Champawat, since it’s a lesser known tourist destination.</p>
        </p><br>
    <p><h3>By Air</h3><br>
        The nearest airport is located at Pantnagar, about 160 kms away, from where you can easily hire cabs, taxis, minivans, buses : both private and government run to reach Champawat.
